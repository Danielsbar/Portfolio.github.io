									<h1>Collaborative Projects<br /></h1>
									<p>In collaboration with a team of individuals, we worked on various projects to suit the teams goals. While assisting with this team I was given the opportunity to use my skills in math and problem-solving, as well as hone my programming knowledge, while collaborating in this group effort.</p>

										<p>One of the bots the team I was working on developed was a program that would take out a loan on the Polygon network, find a group of trading pairs that the result would be greater than the initial loan after fees, repay the loan and return the profits.</p>

										<p>This project was a testing ground that myself and my associates used to test alterations to the math and programming in order to find a method to make a bot that would suit our purposes. We had three main criteria: Accuracy, speed and range. By improvising the algorithm that I developed, we would be able to improve the accuracy of the program, the fewer calculations it required would improve our speed, and the more perfect the algorithm was, the greater the range of profitable trades we could make. </p>

										<p>Similar to the Polygon Arbitrage Bot, this one seeked the same goal with a lot more of a complicated method. Adapting an algorithm from MIT, we were able to calculate percise values to laon only exactly what we needed to maximize profit, and would recieve a loan and buy dozens or hundreds of pairs at specific quanities and values and traded them again with specific pairs before repaying the loan and returning the profit.</p>
